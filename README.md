# Sort-Strings-To-Json README

This is the README for your extension "sort-strings-to-json". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Features

If you are thinking publish localization by your project, I think you need to seperate your strings to local json. And I don't want to change code to move Strings.ko.json , Strings.en.json ... blah blah blah. So I made it. Not sure perfect.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `sortString.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `sortString.dest`: set to destination file in your project for strings seperate
